# Hotwire Dev Tools

Hotwire Dev Tools is a browser extension with the goal of helping developers inspect their Turbo and Stimulus applications.

**Turbo features**:

- Highlight Turbo Frames
- Monitor incoming Turbo Streams
- Display Turbo context information (Turbo Drive enabled, morphing enabled, ...)
- Display warning when a Turbo Frame ID is not unique
- List all Turbo Frames on the page

**Stimulus features**:

- Highlight Stimulus controllers
- List all Stimulus controllers on the page
- Display warning when a `data-controller` doesn't match any registered controller

## Installation

The extension can be installed at:

- [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hotwire-dev-tools/)
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hotwire-dev-tools/phdobjkbablgffmmgnjbmfbbofnbkajc)
- [App Store for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/hotwire-dev-tools/id6503706225)

## Usage

Once installed, click on the extension icon (or press Alt+Shift+S) to open the Dev Tools options.  
From there you can enable/disable the features you want to use.  
_Note: On Firefox you may need to select "Always allow on example.com" to enable the extension on your site._

## Development

- Fork the project locally
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` - to build the extension and watch for changes
- `npm run build` - to bundle the extension into static files for production
- `npm run format` - to format changes with Prettier

> [!NOTE]  
> By default, the extension will be built for Chrome. To build for Firefox or Safari just add `firefox` or `safari` as an argument to the build command: `npm run build firefox` or `npm run build safari`.

### Test on Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable Developer mode
3. Click on `Load unpacked` and select the `public` folder (make sure to build the extension first)

### Test on Firefox

The easiest way is to make use of the [web-ext](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/) tool:

```bash
npm install --global web-ext

cd public
web-ext run
```

That will open a new Firefox instance with the extension installed and hot reloading enabled.

### Test on Safari

First [configure Safari to run unsigned extensions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/running_your_safari_web_extension#3744467):

1. Choose Safari > Settings
2. Select the Advanced tab
3. Check the "Show features for web developers" box
4. Select the Developer tab.
5. Check the Allow unsigned extensions box.

This may depend on the version of macOS and Safari you are using.  
So if you can't find the settings, you may need to search for the specific version you are using.

Then you can load the extension by following these steps:

1. Open Xcode
2. Choose "Open Existing Project"
3. Select the [xcode/HotwireDevTools.xcodeproj](./xcode/HotwireDevTools.xcodeproj) workspace (blue icon)
4. Build the project (you may need to select a team in the project settings -> Signing & Capabilities)
5. Open Safari > Settings > Extensions and enable the Hotwire Dev Tools extension
